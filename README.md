# Azad 1 N(ano) - A small RepRap 3D Printer
While designing it I wanted it to have:
- A heated filament enclosure box as part of itself this is so I can dry filament before printing and keep it protected from dust,
- Powered by USB-C,
- Connects to laptop via a USB-C to C cable rather than having a display and sd-card input,
- Use the A1 mini heatbed + Bambu labs cool plate to print at low temperatures therefore use less power,
- Support the rep rap firmware which can be accessed through the USB C to C cable or perhaps an Ethernet port instead,
- Good drivers to support micro-stepping allowing quiet printing,
- Make the whole build enclosed in a backpack or suitcase.
