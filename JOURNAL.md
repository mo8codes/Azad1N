Total hours so far: 8

- [x] I have a 3D printer

## Day 1 29/3/25 Time spent: 3 Hours
- Made [Azad1N](https://github.com/mo8codes/Azad1N) repository,
- chose name and license,
- started on JOURNAL.md,
- added the Azad 1 Nano to [config.yaml](https://github.com/hackclub/infill/blob/main/doc_update_script/config.yaml) and made a pull request,
- added a short README.md,
- wrote some stuff on paper,
- Watched this video [How to Build a 3D Printer (The Ultimate Guide) by Dr. D-Flo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qub5chyIQ0s).


## Day 2 30/3/25 Time spent: 30 Minutes
- Research and brainstorming,
- Deciding what features I would like to implement in my build,
- Procrastination and transferring everything to one device

## Day 3 31/3/25 Time spent: 30 minutes
- Watched parts of some videos and found some resources to refer too and read later

## Day 4 1/4/25 Time spent: 1 Hour
- Set up Windows and update Fusion,
- Read some stuff,
- Add some details about my printer into the README although I don't know if the features I want to implement can be implemented.

## Day 5 2/4/25 Time spent: 3 Hours
- Making diagrams on paper
- Searching for parts
- Reading
- Decide on the max size (350x320x370mm)
- Made that as a component in Fusion (Just a big cube that I would like to aim to be the maximum size of the printer
- Added the 20x40 V-Rail component
- Watched this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_P36ezmop4

## Day 6 3/4/25 Time spent: 5 minutes
- Drew a bit
- Modified formatting



### To-Do:
- Find cheaper alternatives for these parts,

- Make nice BOM in the README,
- Make the frame in Fusion using the V-rail aluminium extrusion,
- Add the other parts to the Fusion model (motors, gantry, heatbed and coolplate, timing belts),
- Edit readme as the heated, air tight filament enclosure should definitely be seperate,
- Design tool head (extruder, hotend, etc)
- Add tool head to BOM
- Add tool head to CAD
- Design motherboard and power supply(Aim to meet requirements: good motors that support microstepping and usb-c power and ethernet/usb-c data transfer with a interface on device as opposed to a screen)
- Add those to CAD
