Total hours so far: 11

- [x] I have a 3D printer

## Day 1 29/3/25 Time spent: 3 Hours
- Made [Azad1N](https://github.com/mo8codes/Azad1N) repository,
- chose name and license,
- started on JOURNAL.md,

- added a short README.md,
- wrote some stuff on paper,
- Watched this video [How to Build a 3D Printer (The Ultimate Guide) by Dr. D-Flo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qub5chyIQ0s).


## Day 2 30/3/25 Time spent: 30 Minutes
- Research and brainstorming,
- Deciding what features I would like to implement in my build,
- Procrastination and transferring everything to one device

## Day 3 31/3/25 Time spent: 30 minutes

## Day 4 1/4/25 Time spent: 1 Hour
- Set up Windows and update Fusion,
- Read some stuff,
- Add some details about my printer into the README although I don't know if the features I want to implement can be implemented.

## Day 5 2/4/25 Time spent: 3 Hours
- Making diagrams on paper
- Searching for parts
- Reading
- Decide on the max size (350x320x370mm)
- Made that as a component in Fusion (Just a big cube that I would like to aim to be the maximum size of the printer
- Added the 20x40 V-Rail component
- Watched this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_P36ezmop4

## Day 6 3/4/25 Time spent: 5 minutes

- Modified formatting

## Day 7 4/4/25 Time spent: 2 Hours

## Day 8 5/4/25 Time spent: 1 Hour
- Realised my old CAD files weren't saved
- Started the bottom Y-Rail in fusion

### To-Do:
- Finalise part list and printer design (on paper)
- Make nice BOM in the README,
- Make the frame in Fusion using the V-rail aluminium extrusion,
- Add the other parts to the Fusion model (motors, gantry, heatbed and coolplate, timing belts),
- Edit readme as the heated, air tight filament enclosure should definitely be seperate,
- Design tool head (extruder, hotend, etc)
- Add tool head to BOM
- Add tool head to CAD
- Design motherboard and power supply(Aim to meet requirements: good motors that support microstepping and usb-c power and ethernet/usb-c data transfer with a interface on device as opposed to a screen)
- Add those to CAD and BOM
